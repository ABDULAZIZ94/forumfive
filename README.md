# ForumFive v2

A lightweight PHP forum system in less than ~~5kB~~ 10kB. Features email login system, DNSBL checking, rate-limiting, IP logging, HTML support (including youtube/vimeo movies), moderator tools, user profiles, and a nice clean interface.

This system self-installs and uses an SQLite database making backups very simple.

Requires the system to be in the root directory `/` of the site. If you already have a website then place this system in a subdomain such as (`forum.example.com`).

Download the system, edit `forum.php`, and enjoy!
